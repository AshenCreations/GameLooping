# What is this project?

- It is very much a work in progress to build a small game engine to help me slowly learn how to code

- There are half-baked parts of gameloop & Ui with probably what is pretty flimsy code :)

- I'm using C & SDL2 & compiling with .cpp files, so kinda C+. Only really using some simple operator overloading from C++

- VSCode is being used for editing the project & debugging, may move to RemedyBG in the future

- Building the project using a simple build.bat with MSVC cl
