# What is this project?

- It is very much a work in progress to build a small game engine to help me slowly learn how to code

- Building a game loop using fixed interval updates & variable(offset) rendering

- I'm using C & SDL2 & compiling with a build.bat in CL. Only really using some simple operator overloading from C++

- VSCode is being used for editing the project & debugging

# Running

- copy the .exe into same folder as the SDL dll's
