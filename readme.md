# What is this project?

- It is very much a work in progress to build a small game engine to help me slowly learn how to code

- Building a game loop using fixed interval updates & variable(offset) rendering

- I'm using C & SDL2 & compiling with a build.bat in CL. Only really using some simple operator overloading from C++

- VSCode is being used for editing the project & debugging

- should run as long as the SDL dll's,  the .exe , img folder & fonts folder are together

- Esc: quits, F1: takes screenshot
